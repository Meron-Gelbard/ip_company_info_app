I.P to Company Info APP

A simple B2B app for finding company info from B2B API based on the client I.P addresses 

App gets the web page client's I.P and finds info about the I.P owner via web API.

A python-flask site version and a Javascript script version.


Currently using a free public limited info API. Can be hooked to a more powerfull payed service for wider B2B info.

Built as a small internship project for an Online marketing firm.
